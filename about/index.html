  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>My name is Ahmad El-Alfy and I live in Cairo, Egypt. I had passion for the web since I was young. I studied and practiced surgery before taking the decision to drop all that and shift for my passion. Front-end development gained my interest and I started focusing on HTML, performance optimization and the new technologies coming to the web.</p>
  <p>I've built a lot of websites for people / companies across the globe and helped many with troubleshooting / consultations about problems they ran into.</p>
  <p>Currently I work as the VP of technology at <a href="https://robustastudio.com" title="Robusta website">Robusta</a>. I moderate several technology related groups in Egypt and I co-host <a href="https://www.meetup.com/EgyptJS/">EgyptJS</a>; a monthly JavaScript meetup in Cairo. I also teach front-end development at different venues.</p>
