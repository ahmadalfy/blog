  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Well there isn't much to say. My name is Ahmad Alfy and I had a passion for the web since I was young. Recently front-end development gained my interest and I started focusing on HTML5, performance and the new technologies coming to the web.</p>
  <p>I've built a lot of websites for people / companies across the globe and helped many with troubleshooting / consultations about problems they ran into.</p>
  <p>I am a full time technical assistant working for the <a href="http://www.emro.who.int" title="WHO - Eastern Meditteranean Regional Office">World Healt Organization</a> and a front-end developer for <a href="http://webkeyz.com">webkeyz</a> for client-side services.</p>
  <p>I would love to <a href="/contact">hear</a> from you as regard anything related to what's posted on this website.</p>
