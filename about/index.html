  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm Ahmad El-Alfy, a seasoned software engineer with over 20 years of experience in the tech industry. Based in Cairo, Egypt, I’ve had a passion for the web since childhood. After studying and practicing surgery, I took a bold leap to follow my true calling: building fast, beautiful, and innovative web experiences. I specialize in HTML, performance optimization, and cutting-edge web technologies.</p>

  <p>Currently, I serve as the CTO at <a href="https://robustastudio.com" title="Robusta website">Robusta Technology Group</a>, where I lead efforts to create impactful digital solutions and manage high-performing tech teams. In 2023, I was honored to become a <a href="https://developers.google.com/profile/u/alfy">Google Developer Expert (GDE)</a> in Web Technologies and UI, a recognition of my contributions to the field.</p>
  
  <p>I’m deeply involved in the tech community as a moderator for several technology groups in Egypt and a co-host of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/EgyptJS/">EgyptJS</a>, a monthly JavaScript meetup in Cairo. I also share my knowledge by teaching front-end development at various venues. Known for my engaging style, I enjoy breaking down complex topics for audiences of all levels, making technology accessible and relatable.</p>
